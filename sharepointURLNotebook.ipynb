Creed (religious belief) is a prohibited ground.   \\n\\nThis policy applies to all Association employees.  \\n\\nACCOMMODATION\\n\\nEach request to accommodate bona fide religious requirements will be assessed on a case by case basis and having regard to whether the accommodation amounts to undue hardship.\\n\\nIn some cases, the duty to accommodate may involve the following:\\n\\n· Modifications to dress code requirements;\\n\\n· Allowing employees to observe periods of prayer during working hours; and   \\n\\n· Allowing employees to take time off without loss of pay to observe a religious holiday.   \\n\\nLEAVE FOR RELIGIOUS OBSERVANCES \\nThe following guidelines apply to requests for time off from work to observe bona fide religious holidays when employees are scheduled to work: \\n\\n1. Every effort will be made to permit employees time off to observe bona fide religious holidays without loss of pay. \\n\\n2. Various arrangements may be permitted in order to ensure an employee time off without loss of pay. Subject to operational needs, these arrangements may include but are not limited to:  \\n\\n(a) Exchanging shifts;\\n\\n(b) Adjusting schedules; \\n\\n(c) Compressed work weeks; and\\n\\n(d) Individual arrangements to permit the employee to make up work time.\\n\\n3. All changes to scheduling must be authorized by the employee’s immediate Supervisor /Manager.\\n4. Where available, paid floating holidays may be used to observe a religious holiday and employees may bank these days or other lieu time. \\n\\nThis is not an exhaustive list and other arrangements may be available having regard to the employee’s individual circumstances and subject to undue hardship. \\n\\nProcess for Submitting Requests\\n\\nStaff must submit all requests for leave for religious observances in writing to the appropriate Supervisor/Manager at least thirty (30) days in advance of the date(s) required. This will allow sufficient time to consider the request and to determine the appropriate accommodation. If the religious observance is a regular or recurring holiday, staff should submit the request as soon as possible.  \\n\\nRequests for other forms of accommodation, including changes to dress code, should be submitted as soon as possible to the appropriate Supervisor/Manager.\\nAll requests will be responded to in a timely fashion.\\n\\nRelated Documentation:\\n\\nHuman Rights Code\\n\\n\",\n",

Creed (religious belief) is a prohibited ground.   \\n\\nThis policy applies to all Association employees.  \\n\\nACCOMMODATION\\n\\nEach request to accommodate bona fide religious requirements will be assessed on a case by case basis and having regard to whether the accommodation amounts to undue hardship.\\n\\nIn some cases, the duty to accommodate may involve the following:\\n\\n· Modifications to dress code requirements;\\n\\n· Allowing employees to observe periods of prayer during working hours; and   \\n\\n· Allowing employees to take time off without loss of pay to observe a religious holiday.   \\n\\nLEAVE FOR RELIGIOUS OBSERVANCES \\nThe following guidelines apply to requests for time off from work to observe bona fide religious holidays when employees are scheduled to work: \\n\\n1. Every effort will be made to permit employees time off to observe bona fide religious holidays without loss of pay. \\n\\n2. Various arrangements may be permitted in order to ensure an employee time off without loss of pay. Subject to operational needs, these arrangements may include but are not limited to:  \\n\\n(a) Exchanging shifts;\\n\\n(b) Adjusting schedules; \\n\\n(c) Compressed work weeks; and\\n\\n(d) Individual arrangements to permit the employee to make up work time.\\n\\n3. All changes to scheduling must be authorized by the employee’s immediate Supervisor /Manager.\\n4. Where available, paid floating holidays may be used to observe a religious holiday and employees may bank these days or other lieu time. \\n\\nThis is not an exhaustive list and other arrangements may be available having regard to the employee’s individual circumstances and subject to undue hardship. \\n\\nProcess for Submitting Requests\\n\\nStaff must submit all requests for leave for religious observances in writing to the appropriate Supervisor/Manager at least thirty (30) days in advance of the date(s) required. This will allow sufficient time to consider the request and to determine the appropriate accommodation. If the religious observance is a regular or recurring holiday, staff should submit the request as soon as possible.  \\n\\nRequests for other forms of accommodation, including changes to dress code, should be submitted as soon as possible to the appropriate Supervisor/Manager.\\nAll requests will be responded to in a timely fashion.\\n\\nRelated Documentation:\\n\\nHuman Rights Code\\n\\n',\n",
